			<p>The purpose of the game is to develop a planet, enhance your economy, create a fleet, expand your empire, and destroy all those who get in your way.</p>
			<p>While different game modes exist, 8-player ladder games are the most common and are the only way to gather credits.  To win these matches you must either destroy all your enemies, control all 8 homeworlds, or have the highest score at the end of 60 turns.  Each turn can last from seconds to up to a maximum of 3 minutes, but expect an average game to last for around an hour.  A turn will end when that turn's time runs out or when all players click 'End Turn'.</p>
			<p>Everyone goes at the same time during a turn and at the end of each turn resources are gathered and ships in queue to be built are completed.  All other factors in the game take place in real-time.  For the most part, the speed of which you play the game will only matter to those with large empires or to those who like to micro-manage everything.</p>
			<p>Every player starts on a homeworld; they are all identical, not withstanding racial perks.  Each player can choose a race from a limited selection to play before joining a game; each race has its own perks, pros and cons.  To gain access to more races, you must win matches to gain credits that can then be put towards unlocking other races.  You can also put these credits towards single-use and reusable items that can give you a slight edge in game.</p>
			<p>For users who wish to support the development of the game, the purchase of in-game gold with real money can be used to unlock premium gold-only races, certain in-game items, and other small enhancements.  Although wallet warriors will have an easier and more enjoyable time playing the game, they will not have any in-game advantage over non-gold players, as most things can be obtained with just a little bit of time and effort.</p>

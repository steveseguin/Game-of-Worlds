This game was built initially in the new year of 2012. It was to explore the concept of dynamic web applications; xmlhttprequests, etc. How times have changed.

I still own the domain gameofworlds.com and intend to rebuild this game at some point, with the same goals in mind, but using technologies of the future.

This is an open project and I welcome all help.

My old character stories, tech tries, and a product roadmap are available on request.
